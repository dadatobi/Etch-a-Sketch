This it the Odin Projects Etch-A-Sketch project. 

First go at it took me a lot of weeks

i wanted to give up on coding because i was thinking i can't finish this project,
but after finishing to this stage i feel more confident about my career as a developer


i will come back to work more on this project after i have more knowledge about some more syntax
